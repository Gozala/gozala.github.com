Majority of web applications today are data owners. Yes, even if data is 
mine, it's still owned by application, since all the ways to interact with it
go through application. In some cases application kindly allows to export and
import data, sometimes even delete or access it  with other applications, but
the point is, that somehow it is always between me, my tooling and my data. 
For example I just can't simply move my social activity data access privileges 
from Facebook to MySpace or vise versa.

Still not sure weather this is fundamentally wrong or just can be better. One
way or another, [Taskhub] is an experiment, trying to make it differently. 
With [Taskhub] I am an owner of my data and application itself is just a tool
of my choice to interact with my data. To achieve this, [Taskhub] takes
[Jekyll] like approach and saves tasks as [Markdown] formatted, plain text 
[gist]s. This way application respects my freedom of choice by allowing me
to switch to any alternative task manager at any moment, making switch as
painless as it can get, just stop using it. And if I'll decide to switch back,
[Taskhub] will just work. Think in summary, data is just mine and it should 
not bound me to any application. One can say here that it's 
bounded to [github], but it's not true, because [github] in this case is just
wire that connects my data to the cloud. In ideal world we will have "Data
Clouds", virtual hard drives with standard data access APIs. Users will buy 
them to store their data, just like they do with hard drives today.

For the moment [Taskhub] is just a geek toy, but I hope to see it's decedents,
being more useful to a regular users, one way of doing this is through adding
support of saving data in less geeky storage, for example saving data to files
in [Dropbox], will make a trick, besides it's a step towards "Data Clouds".

I'm not in illusions that, high performance will be easy to achieve with this
model, but I do believe in smart people :).

###Under the hood###

- HTML5 [Offline web applications]  
As I mentioned high performance with this model is not easy. To reach 
acceptable performance application uses HTML5 localStorage for a live data, 
that concurrently gets synchronized with a gist storage. HTML5 offline application
caching APIs are used to make it possible to run application while being 
offline. All the data is synchronized once user goes back online. So far 
there is no conflict resolutions, because of limited gist APIs, so browser
always gets priority, which leads to a funny results when used with multiple
clients. Fixing this is on my taskhub list, so stay tuned.

- [CommonJS]  
Application is build on top of [CommonJS]. It uses [yet another](# "Actually
one of the first browser based CommonJS module loaders") CommonJS module 
loader [Teleport], which asynchronously delivers modules from mapped
[CommonJS package]s. One of the main components / packages is [github library]
allowing to list, read and write gists straight from a browser and I'll be 
posting details about it in the next post.

- Backendless  
One of the interesting moments of architecture is in it's selfhostness. That
makes it possible to run app from any server, it even can be dropped to 
[dropbox] or can be used directly from local filesystem.
