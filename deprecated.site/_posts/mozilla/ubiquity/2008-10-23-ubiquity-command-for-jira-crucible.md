So…

I don’t post a lot unfortunately, the reason is that I don't really have time
to play with some interesting stuff to post about it later :( But fortunately
I found some time for creating ubiquity command.

I have to work a lot with [JIRA] & [Crucible] at my [day job]. So I've decided 
to simplify my life somehow :)

I was thinking about this already for a long time... I also wanted to check
out Ubiquity, but from the internal side. I have decided to give it a try. I
followed very nice [tutorial], to be honest I was amazed to see it being so
complete. Usually it’s completely different when dealing with mozilla.

Result seems to be quite nice at least it is what I was targeting to you can
give it a try if you are also dealing with jira or crucible. Actually there 
are some other Ubiquity command related to the [JIRA] but they seem to be site
specific and settings are hardcoded. In with this command you can set your 
jira / crucible URL and enjoy it.
