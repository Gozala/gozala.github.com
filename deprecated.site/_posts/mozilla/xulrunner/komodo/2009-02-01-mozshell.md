In this post I am going to write about one of my projects, which I presented 
at [FOSDEM], during Mozilla lightning talks. Unfortunately I had not enough
time to give a good idea what what is [Mozshell] and what potential it has...

For several years already, I'm working with XUL and JavaScript in different 
companies and different applications. I think every extension / xulrunner 
developers will agree that there are no reliable tools for our hard job, what
makes development process slower and more complicated. Well there are tools 
like [Venkman] and Chrome bug, but if you can can make them work on Firefox,
you will never manage to make them work properly on other third party 
XULRunner based applications. Even if you will it's quite different from 
having well integrated tool into your primary editor. So that's how I got 
inspired to write an extension for [Komodo Edit] which add's JavaScript shell 
and Object inspector to the editor. It is not just another js shell among 
hundred others. It is quite unique by its architecture and really interesting
features. [Mozshell] is focused on xulrunner / extension developers, it gives
ability to create remote connections to _(any xulrunner based)_ applications,
no meter if they are running on the local machine, or different remote, or 
even virtual machines. You can evaluate JavaScriptduring run-time, Inspect 
Objects, etc.. Because of the name some people might confused, integration 
with an editor makes it completely different from what we call shell but at 
the same time experimental interface makes it much easier and fast to use.

Extension is still on the very early stage of development but still you can 
give it a try and give some feedback!!

Project of course is an open source and can be [found here][Mozshell]
