There is a [bug(#407356)][bug-407356] in [XULRunner] on Linux with non English 
keyboard layouts which breaks keyboard shortcuts like  [CTRL + C], [CTRL + V],
[CTRL + T] which effectively complicates life.

If you run in to the same issue as well you'll be happy to find out that I 
have implemented [Keyzilla] extension, which works with [Firefox], 
[Thunderbird], [Songbird] and [Komodo Edit]. Hope Mozilla will fix 
[this bug][bug-407356] soon & will this extension useless, but till then 
my extension will help you out!
