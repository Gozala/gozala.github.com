# March 5

Last night I worked on [xcrpt extension][]. Resurrected some code from [web cards][] concept in the   [browser.html][] history and integrated it into extension. Clicking a toolbar button brings up a web card and archived view of the page.

Now (11AM) focusing on generating card from the selection. I remember having done some work on this in the past, and every solution had it's drawbacks:

- [Highlighting selection by enclosing nodes][highlight-by-wrapping] altered DOM. And given that selection was represented through multiple nodes it is not really possible to change color of highlight on hover (without adding JS code which we do not want to do)
- [Drawing selection with SVG overlay][highlight-ancestor] addressed problem of scattered nodes however it relied on `z-index` which can be error prone.
- [DOM Selection <â€“> Resource Selector][capture-restore-selection] attempted to capture selection as a [Resource Selector][] from [Web Annotations][] specification and to create [DOM Selection][] from [Resource Selector][].

I am realizing I need to spend more time reading on [Web Annotations][] as it is clearly relevant to what we are doing here.

Yesterday [@pvh][] mentioned wanting to capture selections in a URLs our xcrpt will have.  Which reminded me of the [thread on twitter][portals-twitter-thread] and a [ScrollToTextFragment][] web platform proposal to allow specifying a text snippet in a URL fragment. I think we should look into it and consider how it fits with this work and learn what is already out there.



Going over the [Web Annotations][] spec I think we should capture / store selections in the format that follows the specification and will look something along the following lines

```json
{
  "@context": "http://www.w3.org/ns/anno.jsonld",
  "id": "https://xcr.pt/${uuid}",
  "created": "2020-03-05T20:30:47.519Z",
  "generator": "https://exr.pt",
  "type": "Annotation",
  "motivation": "commenting",
  "body": {
    "type": "TextualBody",
    "value": "This seems relevant to our research"
  },
  "target": {
    "type": "SpecificResource",
    "source": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memex",
    "selector": [
      {
        "type": "CssSelector",
        "value": "#mw-content-text",
        "refinedBy": {
          "type": "TextQuoteSelector",
          "exact": "The memex would have features other than linking",
          "prefix": "",
          "suffix": "The user could record new information on microfilm"
        }
      },
      {
        "type": "CssSelector",
        "value": "#mw-content-text > div:nth-child(1) > p:nth-child(15) ",
        "refinedBy": {
          "type": "RangeSelector",
          "startSelector": {
            "type": "TextPositionSelector",
            "start": 0,
            "end": 0
          },
          "endSelector": {
            "type": "TextPositionSelector",
            "start": 49,
            "end": 49
          }
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Turns out [hypothes.is][] client also uses web annotation data model, that is what client seems to [fetch from the server][hypothesis payload].

Reading up more on Web Annotations

> [4.3.3 Refinement of State](https://www.w3.org/TR/annotation-model/#refinement-of-state)

> Similar to the [refinement of selection](https://www.w3.org/TR/annotation-model/#refinement-of-selection), it may be easier, more reliable or more accurate to specify the  appropriate state of the resource as a hierarchy of atomic State  resources. 

The `cached` field can provide a link to a copy of the source resource's representation. 

> [Example 31: Time State](https://www.w3.org/TR/annotation-model/#example-27)

> ```json
> {
>     "@context": "http://www.w3.org/ns/anno.jsonld",
>     "id": "http://example.org/anno31",
>     "type": "Annotation",
>     "body": "http://example.org/note1",
>     "target": {
>        "source": "http://example.org/page1",
>        "state": {
>          "type": "TimeState",
>          "cached": "http://archive.example.org/copy1",
>          "sourceDate": "2015-07-20T13:30:00Z"
>        }
>     }

We should point to our archived copies.

Wound up in the rabbit hole of trying to capture selected image in the clipped card. It took me a while to figure out that that problem I was running into. Turns out that [`cloneContents()`][]  of [`Selection`][] [`Range`][] return DOM fragment with images that aren't loaded, which in turned caused scraper code to reject those as they did not meet min with / height requirements (as such images appear to have 0 [`naturalWidth`][]). After figuring what was the problem, I have spend time making custom range content iterator instead _(which is a lot trickier than it may appear as selection can cover nodes partially and start and end can be at different depth in the DOM tree)_.

After a needed break I realized I was overthinking all this and instead settled on solution that just probed images from [`commonAncestorContainer`][] and filtered out ones that fell out of selection. I think it is worth spending a lot more time on choosing a right image for the clip, but only after POC is done. In the end I have something that seems to work well in my experience:
