# WebTorrent concept browser

[@tom-james-watson][]  implemented a concept distributed web browser powered by torrents. Instead of the traditional client/server architecture, websites are published and loaded via torrents. [wtp-ext][] web extension uses [libdweb](./libdweb) to add `wtp://` protocol support to the Firefox.
