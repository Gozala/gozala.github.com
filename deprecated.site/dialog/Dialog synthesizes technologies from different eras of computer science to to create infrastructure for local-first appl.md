Dialog synthesizes technologies from different eras of computer science to to create infrastructure for local-first applications and overcome limitations of existing solutions

**Design combines:**

- **Semantic triples** (RDF, Datomic) - representing data as facts rather than rows or documents. Indexing strategy providing optimal retrieval across all possible access patterns.
- **Datalog** (deductive databases, logic programming) - declarative queries and rules replacing need for document or table schemas and their evolution.
- **Probabilistic Search Trees** (Merkle Search Trees, Prolly Trees, Geometric Trees) - Replacing traditional B-Tree's used in convention database enabling efficient replication.
- **CRDTs** - Enable multiplayer async collaboration without authoritative servers
- **Content-addressed storage** (Git, IPFS) - Immutable, verifiable data structures
- **UCANs** - Capability based access control that works offline 

**This synthesis enables new capabilities:** Semantic facts allow applications to interpret shared data without a consensus on schema, enabling them to evolve and cooperate on shared data independently. Datalog queries combined with covering indexes enable query-driven, on-demand partial replication. History Independent, Probabilistic Search Trees make identifying differences between replicas efficient enabling fast replication.

Dialog builds on design of Datomic (database as a value) that combined semantic data model with datalog. Unlike Datomic, more traditional databases like PostgreSQL, MariaDB or cutting edge database like Dolt (which also has git like characteristics) Dialog is a tool for building local-first software as opposed to a tool for building SAAS product. Dialog is design for seamless support of offline cooperation across multiple concurrent applications with possibly divergent schemas. This implies choosing eventual consistency over strong consistency model and built-in conflict resolution. Enabling various application to cooperate without requiring consensus on schema or coordinated update cycles and builtin replication system sets up apart from SQLite and led us to a different data model and query interface. Dialog also builds upon lot of hard work and research in CRDTs, but unlike Automerge, Yjs, Diamond it is a database that can query over large datasets than could be fit in memory.







Probabilistic Search Trees enable query-driven partial replication - nodes sync only the data they need. Datalog provides both powerful queries and reactive UI definitions through temporal extensions inspired by Dedalus.



**This synthesis creates emergent properties aligned with local-first principles:**

Unlike traditional databases, the semantic model enables schema-free cooperation between applications. Unlike industry standard CRDTs, Datalog enables queries over large datasets. Unlike existing probabilistic search tree implementations, our approach optimizes for network I/O and query-driven partial replication.

**Prior art includes:** Datomic (semantic facts with time-travel), RhizomeDB (causal consistency), Automerge/Yjs (CRDTs), and Dolt (Git-like database). Dialog uniquely combines these ideas to enable databases that sync through blob stores without coordination servers, support query-driven partial replication, and allow applications to share data without coordinating schemas.

**We acknowledge this rich lineage while focusing on the specific synthesis that makes local-first databases practical."**

This version:

- Emphasizes synthesis over invention
- Shows how combination creates new properties
- Respects prior work while highlighting unique contribution
- More academic/research-oriented tone





**Dialog DB faces several significant technical challenges in creating a practical local-first database:**

**1. Efficient Query-Driven Partial Replication** Existing sync approaches require either full dataset replication or pre-defined partition schemes. Dialog must dynamically determine which subtrees of the Probabilistic Search Tree to replicate based on active queries, while maintaining consistency guarantees. This requires novel algorithms for tracking query dependencies and efficiently computing minimal replication sets.

**2. Multi-Writer Conflict Resolution at Scale** While CRDTs solve simple conflicts, database-scale operations introduce complex scenarios: schema evolution in multiple directions, large-scale merges, and maintaining referential integrity across partial replicas. We must develop merge strategies that preserve application semantics while remaining comprehensible to developers.

**3. Performance Parity with Traditional Databases** Local-first operation cannot compromise on performance. Key challenges include: optimizing Datalog evaluation over sparse replicas, implementing incremental view maintenance for reactive queries, and minimizing network round-trips during sync. Our Probabilistic Search Trees must balance node size, tree depth, and boundary stability for network-optimized operation.

**4. Cross-Platform Deployment** Targeting both web (WASM) and native environments with consistent performance requires careful architecture. Memory constraints in browsers, varying storage APIs, and different threading models across platforms demand flexible abstraction layers without sacrificing efficiency.

**These challenges require both theoretical advances and engineering excellence to create a database that truly empowers users without compromising functionality.**
