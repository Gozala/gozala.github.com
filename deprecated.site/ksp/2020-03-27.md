# March 27

After exploring markdown related crates I have chose to use [pulldown-cmark][]. However I run into problem as it does not emit information about [reference link identifiers][pulldown-cmark-link-id-issue], other libraries seem to have the same limitations _(event JS ones that I have considered to use instead)_. End up [implementing it myself][pulldown-cmark-link-id-pull], until changes make itself into upstream using [`[patch]` section][cargo-patch] to replace a dependency with my fork.
