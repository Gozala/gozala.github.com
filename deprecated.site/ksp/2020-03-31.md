When process is started it needs to be told which paths to scan, it also needs to be notified when new paths are added or when some paths are removed. My current thinking is that initial paths will be passed as an argument and any changes will be notified through `stdin`.

It might be worth considering simpler initial approach of exposing `scan` mutation endpoint e.g. `mutation { scan("file:///path/to/dir") }` would starts a scanner process for a given path, which would just scan through and submit all discovered connections for ingestion. And have a separate `{ track("file:///path/to/dir") }` endpoint which will watch directory for changes and re-scan changed files to update connections. 

------

After meeting with @pvh we have decided that it does not makes sense to spend time improving scanner by making it able to react to changes what paths it should tack, reindex on startup etc.. Instead we'll just make `knowledge-server --scan /path/to/my/dir` do the work of scanning path and adding links to the database.

Next I'll work on the browser-extension that does following:

- Captures links on the pages you visit and submits those to the ksp.
- Queries ksp to surface all the backlinks to the page you're on.
