# Actors in JS

In the days before JS had promises or `async` / `await` managing code complexity in large applications was a nightmare a.k.a callback hell. TomTom Home and Firefox extensions later that I was employed to work during those days suffered with that problem as well. However Spidermonkey JS engine even back then had generators and my exposure to Erlang inspired me to utilize thouse to design a better async programming model.

At a time I have successfully deployed this solution across organizations and teams to overcome challenges of async programing.
