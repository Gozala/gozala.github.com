# IPFS protocol support in Firefox

[I have collaborated with IPFS][ipfs-collaboration]  team to integrate [libdweb](./libdweb) into [IPFS Companion][] Firefox extension. This made it possible to get a fully functional IPFS node in Firefox with a support for `ipfs://` URLs.

This inspired [Brave browser][] to develop [libdweb](./libdweb) like extension APIs to get IPFS protocol support.

[Opera web browser][] also since have announced plans to [add support for IPFS protocol][ipfs-opera].
