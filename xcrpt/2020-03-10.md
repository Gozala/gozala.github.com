### Content Height

Spend some time trying to figure out why on some pages [height of captured content was inadequate][#1] e.g. on notes.andymatuschak.org. In short it was due to the fact that `document.body.scrollHeight` at frame load did report short.

Investigated alternative approaches to iframe for rendering captured page. The most promising one relied on [css transform][]

```css
body {
  transform: translateY(100vh)
}

#excerpt {
  position: absolute;
  top: 0;
  left: 0;
  width: 100%;
  transform: translateY(-100vh);
}
```

However it is not compatible with responsive design principals challenging making a reasonable header without restricting a comment size / selection size.

I also looked into possibility of keeping `#excerpt` inside a `<head>` but I was unable to succeed with this approach either. Looked into web components route, which involved a lot of JS which and I gave up before exploring this route much further.

#### Progressbar

Worked on implementing a progress bar to show that archiving is in progress. 

<video src="progressbar.mov" mute controls></video>

<center>White progressbar at the bottom</center> 

### Keyboard shortcuts

Worked on adding keyboard shortcuts `Escape` to abort the excerpt and `Enter` to save / upload excerpt.
