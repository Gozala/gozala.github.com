Focusing on filesystem scanner, which will find markdown files in designated paths, parse them and submit links for ingestion. Simple approach proved to be problematic as it goes into all the paths that are odd to be ignored and usually are by `.gitignore`. This lead me to look for if there are things that already do it. Specifically I've looked at what popular [ripgrep][] does as it likely had to address these problems.

Turns out it does has member crate [ignore][] that provides a fast recursive directory iterator that respects various filters and `.gitignore` files. Using it I put together a scanner that finds appropriate files.

Next looking for the markdown parser library to extract links from them.
