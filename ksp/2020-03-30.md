# March 30

Implement [front matter][] block parsing to extract tags from the scanned markdown files. Run into some complications with rust lifetimes.

Decided that daemon and scanner will be one binary, that way daemon could start scanner by spawning same binary in a child process by passing a `--scanner` flag. This created a circular dependency between scanner and daemon that rust does not allow.

Moved the primary component of the knowledge server into separate "base" member turning "daemon" just a wrapper coordinating "base" and "scanner" components.
