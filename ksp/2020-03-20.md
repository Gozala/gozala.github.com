Still thinking about resource relations and db schema. Seeing reflection of [RDF][] really scares me. Projecting db tables in attempt to gather some insights. [BLA][]

#### Resources

| RES_ID | URL                                           |
| ------ | --------------------------------------------- |
| 1      | file:///Users/gozala/Notes/farm.md            |
| 2      | https://www.inkandswitch.com/local-first.html |
| 3      | https://automerge.github.io/                  |
| 4      | ksp://markdown/ref-link                       |
| 5      | ksp://markdown/inline-link                    |
| 6      | ksp://tag/local-first                         |

#### Connections

_Will be IDs but projecting actual data instead_

| FROM_RES_ID         | TO_REST_ID                   | REL_ID                     |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| file:///.../farm.md | https://.../local-first.html | ksp://markdown/ref-link    |
| file:///.../farm.md | https://automerge.github.io/ | ksp://markdown/inline-link |
| file:///.../farm.md | https://.../local-first.html | ksp://tag/local-first      |

From this data we can infer following:

- `farm.md` (reference) linked to `local-first.html`.
- `farm.md` (inline) linked to `automerge.github.io`.
- `local-first.html` (reference) back-linked to `farm.md`.
- `automerge.github.io` (inline) back-linked to `farm.md`.
- `local-first.html` is tagged as `local-first` by `farm.md`.
- `farm.md` is (term) linked to `local-first`.
- `local-first.html` is (term) back-linked to `farm.md`.

Evaluating if assumption that [GraphQL][] would indeed be a good fit. I would like to sketch out schema, populate it with data (described above) and run quires against to get a sense of what it's like. Looking for a tool along the lines of [Observable][] or [JSBin][] for this.

The best I could find was [GraphQL Faker][], it does not store data nor it is a web tool, but allowed me to create draft schema and some run quires never the less.

```graphql

  """

}

  """

}

"""

"""
type SimilarResource {
  target: Resource!
}

union Connection = ReferenceLink | InlineLink | Tag | SimilarResource

type Query {
  connections(url: String): [Connection!]
}

```

I am convinced that [GraphQL][] is the way to go because:

- It can represent, well graphs.
- Client can choose depth of queries.
- Fields are resolved lazily.
- Results are typed.
