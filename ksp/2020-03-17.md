# March 17

Attempted to incorporate feedback from @pvh on KSAP proposal, by adding user story and documenting how does it help to overcome some of the problems with it.

Added a section comparing KSAP to existing tools attempting to solve the same problem.

----

Reading [Annotation Protocol Specification][] to see if it would be a good fit for KSAP and taking notes:

> The Web Annotation Protocol describes the transport mechanisms for creating and managing annotations in a method that is consistent with the Web Architecture and REST best practices.



> The primary aim of the Web Annotation Protocol is to provide a standard  set of interactions that allow annotation clients and servers to interoperate seamlessly

I did not found Annotation Protocol specification particularly relevant. It is great that open protocol is defined and that makes it possible to pull data from potentially many different providers. However interface itself is very primitive. It allows organizing annotations into Annotation Containers that is ordered lists annotations.

> An Annotation Container is at the same time both a Container [[ldp][]] (a service for managing Annotations) and an OrderedCollection [[activitystreams-core][]] (an ordered list of Annotations).

I am inlined to think that graphs are better fit for the our use case. There for moving onto assessing https://graphql.org/ ecosystem to see what is available and if there something that fits well KSAP needs.

Discussed more use cases with @pvh on Slack to carve a useful piece out of the proposed concept. 

> Named links you can refer to from anywhere

Discussion was helped me recognize the fact that restricting associations to URLs is not a useful limitation. Reframing the problems as **tags** seems to be a more flexible approach. You can associate two URLs with the same tag to the same effect. Also it is possible to use URL as tag itself.

Discussing this concept further lead to following following use case:

> Ability to expand "local-first" anywhere in the browser / text editor / slack



Based on our discussion this is what I'm thinking we odd to prototype:

1. Way to associating resources (tagging more broadly)
2. Surfacing those associations across tools

For surfacing associations browser extension could query KSAP and present them in the context of the page (Something along the lines of https://notes.andymatuschak.org/, Wiki style footnotes, or more conservative sidebar).


 For associating resources one I thought we could do following:

 1. Us web extension to tap into bookmarks API to feed tags KSAP.
 2. Create CLI interface for KSAP to allow associating anything on the system, without writing plugins to every single tool (and some don't even support that)
 3. Amend our [xcrpt][] add-on to submit associations into KSAP as well.

I am still not satisfied, seems like something is missing.
