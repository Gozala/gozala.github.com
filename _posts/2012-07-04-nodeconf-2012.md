I had a great pleasure of attending [nodeconf][] taking place in [portland][]. Conference far exceeded all my expectations. While this post has no chance to capture all of the
interesting things I've seen, I still would like to make an effort to highlight at least
a fraction that is still on my mind.

First off I would love to thank [Mikael Rogers][] and everyone who helped him to set
a whole new standard of how conferences should be held! Theatrical feel was throug the
whole conference, venue at [Imago theatre][], talks flowing into each other according
to very well crafted scenario. Remarkably single track (or single thread if you will :) model was used, which proved once again to fit JS perfectly. Another novelity was in a
"save questions for the bar" rule that worked out very well.

## Day 1


I learend little bit of a history about how & why node was started. How unstable, but
still fun it was to work with at it's early days. How it matured and got deployed into
production at [Yammer][] and elsewhere. Why companies like Microsoft invest into nodejs
and how it became first class citizen on windows, which was not easy and required whole
new platform layer today known as [libuv][]. Learned how it can be used to write nodejs
like servers in **C** and how much work is still ahead to make it better. Use of [libuv][]
has expanded far beyound nodejs: Mozilla's own [rust][] language, [Luvit][] node for a
Lua language and even crazy new languages like [candor][] with a dedicated VM that has
a JIT compiler and is written by a single person.

It turns out there is a nodejs powered [karaoke bar][Bar API] in portland that has a
public rest API. That is also where first night party was, where I was rocking out with
others until I almost lost my voice, my appologies to everyone who had to bear with that.

## Day 2

Node is all about streaming and pipeing data, and that's what everyone should do! Streams are not magic pouder though, sometimes buffering is a way to go, either way everyone should
benchmark to make reasonable decisions about how code should be written. 

Nodify browser

Scaling node huge amount of users. Tools that can be used to benchmark, profile and hant a memory leaks. 

Crazy hardware: motion based spammers, js powered robots!


### Party

JS band.


## other 

got some folks excited about lispy
being encouraged to submit talks for jsconfeu

Thank you mozilla.
