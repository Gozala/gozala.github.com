I had a great pleasure of attending [nodeconf][] taking place in [portland][]. Conference far exceeded all my expectations. While this post has no chance to capture all of the
interesting things I've seen, I still would like to make an effort to highlight at least
a fraction that is still on my mind.

First off I would love to thank [Mikael Rogers][] and everyone who helped him to set
a whole new standard of how conferences should be held! Theatrical feel was throug the
whole conference, venue at [Imago theatre][], talks flowing into each other according
to very well crafted scenario. Remarkably single track (or single thread if you will :) model was used, which proved once again to fit JS perfectly. Another novelity was in a
"save questions for the bar" rule that worked out very well.

## Talks

It turns out there is a nodejs powered [karaoke bar][Bar API] in portland that has a
public rest API.
