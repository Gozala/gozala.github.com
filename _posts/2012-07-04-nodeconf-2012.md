I had a great pleasure of attending [nodeconf][] that took place in [portland][].
Conference far exceeded all my expectations. This post has no chance to capture all of the
interesting things that happende there, but I still would like to make an effort to share 
some of the highlights that are still on my mind.

First off I would love to thank [Mikael Rogers][] and everyone who helped him to set
a whole new standard of how conferences should be held! Theatrical feel was throug the
whole conference, venue was at [Imago theatre][] & all the talks flow into each other
according to well crafted scenario. Remarkably single track (or single thread if you will
:) model was used, which once again proved to be a perfect fit for event(ed) JS. Another
novelity was in a "save questions for the bar" rule that worked out amazingly well.

## Day I

Both nodejs and conference was started by a [Ryah Dahl][], who shared with us a little bit
of a background story on how & why node was started. Then very first contributors took
a scene to talk about very early days of project, when it was very unstable, but
still very fun to hack on. That flowed into talks about how node was maturing and making
it's way into production at [Yammer][] and elsewhere. Was interesting to learn why
companies like Microsoft invest into nodejs and how it became first class citizen on
windows. That required core changes to an underline platform layer resulting into
[libuv][]. There were several interesting talks about [libuv][] specifically, showing
how node like servers can be written in **C**, how much work is still ahead to be done, and how [libuv][] go life of it's own. Today it is used by other new projects, including
Mozilla's own [rust][] language, by [Luvit][] - node for a Lua language. I was completely
blown away by [Fedor Indutny][]'s crazy simple language [candor][] with dedicated VM and
a JIT compiler he wrote. Unfortunately I did not get a chance to chat with him as he
disapeared immediately after his talk.

At the end of the day we all headed to a bar. It turned out there is a nodejs powered
[karaoke bar][] in portland, that even has a [public REST API][Bar API]. That is also
where I was rocking out with others until almost loosing a voice (My appologies to
everyone who had to bare with that).


## Day II

Node is all about streaming and pipeing data from one stream to another. That's what it's
good at and thats what everyone writing node programs should embrace! We got some
interesting talks on that topic. Although as follow up talks demoed streams are not a
magic pouder that makes things fast, sometimes buffering is a better approach. Most
important take away was that everyone should benchmark and make reasonable decisions based
on numbers not instintcts (I feel people often tend to forget about this). It was also interesting to learn how streams and other node concepts had being used to drive inovation
into browsers.

Another section of talks covered scaling node. That envolved talks about tools for
benchmarking, profiling, memory leak hunting and real life experience from [Voxer][].

Last section of talks was about hardware that completely blowed away everybodys minds!
All kinds of crazy stuff, that I won't even attempt to describe, just make sure to watch
videos once they're realized! Here is small video of [Rick Waldron][]'s amazing node
powered [robot][] to give you an idea.

After party had an epic live performance from the band assembled of a fellow community members! You guys really rocked! 

## Socializing

It was pleasure to finally meet friends from internet. I'm also super happy I got a
chance to share some of my ideas how I think node streams can be made even better,
I'm encouraged and plan to put more effort into this. Also, glad I got some folks
excited about my recent obsession [lispyscript][]! Also thank for encouraging me to
submit a talk for upcoming [jsconf.eu][], I plan on doing it this weekend!


Speciall thanks to **Mozilla** for letting me be part of this!
