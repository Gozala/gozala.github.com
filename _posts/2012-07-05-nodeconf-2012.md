I had a great pleasure of attending [nodeconf][] that took place in [Portland][].
Conference far exceeded all my expectations. This post has no chance to capture
all of the interesting things that happened there, but I still would like to
make an effort and share some of the highlights.

First off I would love to thank [Mikael Rogers][] and everyone who helped him
to set a whole new standard of how conferences should be held! Theatrical feel
was through the whole conference: venue at [Imago theatre][], talks that
flowed into each other according to well crafted scenario. Remarkably single
track (or single thread if you will :) model was used, which once again proved
to be a perfect fit for event(ed) JS. Another novelty was in a "save questions
for the bar" rule that worked out amazingly well.

## Day I

Both nodejs and conference was started by a [Ryah Dahl][], who shared with us a
little bit of a background story on how & why node was started. Then very
first contributors took a scene to talk about very early days of project, when
it was very unstable, but still very fun to hack on. That flowed into talks
about how node was maturing and making it's way into production at [Yammer][]
and elsewhere. Was interesting to learn why companies like Microsoft invest
into nodejs and how it became first class citizen on windows. That required
core changes to an underline platform layer resulting into [libuv][]. There
were several interesting talks about [libuv][], specifically showing how
node like servers can be written in **C**, how much work is still ahead to
be done, and how [libuv][] go life of it's own. Today it is used by other
new projects, including Mozilla's own [rust][] language, by [Luvit][] - node
for a Lua language. I was completely blown away by [Fedor Indutny][]'s crazy
simple language [candor][] with dedicated VM and JIT compiler he wrote.
Unfortunately I did not get a chance to chat with him as he disappeared
immediately after his talk.

At the end of the day we all headed to a bar. It turned out there is a
nodejs powered [karaoke bar][] in portland, that even has a
[public REST API][Bar API]. That is also where I was [rocking out][] with others
until almost loosing a voice (My apologies to everyone who had to bare
with that).


## Day II

Node is all about [streaming and piping][streams-talk] data from one stream
to another. That's what it's good at and that's what everyone writing node
programs should embrace! We got some interesting talks on that topic.
Although there was a talk that demoed that streams are not a magic dust that
makes things fast, sometimes buffering is a better approach. Most important
take away was that everyone should benchmark to make reasonable decisions
based on numbers, not instincts (I feel people often tend to jump to
conclusions without any mesures). It was also interesting to learn how
streams and other node concepts had being used to drive innovation into
browsers.

Another section of talks covered scaling node. That involved talks about tools
for benchmarking, profiling, memory leak hunting and real life experience
from [Voxer][].

Final section of talks was about hardware that completely blew away everybody's
minds! All kinds of crazy stuff, that I won't even attempt to describe, just
make sure to watch videos once they're realized! Here is small teaser of
[Rick Waldron][]'s amazing node powered [robot][] to give you an idea.

After party had an epic live performance from the band assembled of a fellow
community members! You guys really rocked, I still don't understand how did
you manage to put this amazing performance without much practice.

## Socializing

It was pleasure to finally meet friends from internet. I'm also super happy I
got a chance to share some of my ideas how I think node streams can be made
[even better][reducers], I'm encouraged and plan to put more effort into
this. Also, glad I got some folks excited about my recent obsession
[lispyscript][]! Finally thanks for encouraging me to submit a talk for
upcoming [jsconf.eu][], I'm motivated and plan on doing it this weekend!


Speciall thanks to **Mozilla** for letting me be part of this amazing event!
