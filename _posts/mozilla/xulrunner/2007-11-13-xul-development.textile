It's cool tool to develop XUL.
I want bother you talking about what is XUL or what can be done with it.. if you don't know & you wonder you can check it here >> <a href="http://www.xulplanet.com/">http://www.xulplanet.com/</a>


Now Lets talk about my FireEclipse!!!
There's nothing special I've done but, now it's great tool to use while developing firefox, thunderbird, songbird extensions or just to edit .xul & .xbl files. For the moment it's only for the linux platform and tested only on <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu 7.10</a> I'll show you some photos of my lovely FireEclipse and will tell you what it can do!!

</span><ol style="font-family:arial;"><li>Create Simple XUL project or XUL extension Project

</a></li><li>You can write xul code in the eclipse, or can just drag and drop  XUL elements from snippets, you can see the  XUL tab in it.

</li><li>You also can see preview tab on the picture.. thats embedded mozilla browser in eclipse, so you can preview what you're writing :)

FireEclipse it's just eclipse 3.2 IDE with </span><span style="font-family:arial;">embedded jdk and plugins: </span><span style="font-family:arial;">WTP 1.5, ATF 0.2.1 and XULBooster 0.1.7 with embedded.

If any of you wants to try you can <a href="http://www.lds.ge/files/FireEclipse.tar.gz">take it!!</a>
As I told you, It's only Linux build and tested only on my & few of my colleges Ubuntu 7.10.
The FireEclipse was designed for the local use only, maybe if you'll be interested we'll contact the xulbooster team and if they won't mind we will distribute the FireEclipse Regullary, and for all the platforms... as for now you can download it and extract anywhere you want!!

after you'll extract it you can run it from FireEclipse/eclipse/eclipse.



The second great tool for XUL Developers is <a href="http://www.openkomodo.com/">Open Komodo!!!</a>
The great tool is build on Mozilla platform. Tool to Develope XUL, Developed on XUL :)

I just found it so I didn't had enough time to test it well, but with firs look it's impressing.
I advice you to try it..
As for me I feel more comfortable in eclipse

Thats it, Have nice XUL!!!
