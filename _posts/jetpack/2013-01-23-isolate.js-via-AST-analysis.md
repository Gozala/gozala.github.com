In add-on SDK we have one problem that is being both annoying and confusing
for a lot of our users. Also I problem is not very SDK specific and probably
general to an JS that has to deal with concurrent execution contexts.

## Problem overview

Add-on SDK was designed to be compatible with browser architecture where chrome
and content may be in separate isolated processes. This imposes a lot of
limitations on how add-ons code can interact with a page / tab content and
lack of concurrency constructs in a language make this problems a lot more
irritating. We end up implementing [web workers][] like API where main add-on
code can execute content scripts in a page contexts which act like workers and
interaction between them happens through a message passing.

We quickly discovered that not a lot of people are comfortable with message
passing style APIs, but putting that aside it's really annoying to create a
separate content script file for just a few lines of JS code:





    #!env/javascript
    var pageMod = require("sdk/page-mod");
    var mod = new pageMod.PageMod({
      include: ["*.co.uk"],
      contentScript: "document.body.innerHTML = " +
                     "'<h1>this page has been eaten</h1>';"
    }));
