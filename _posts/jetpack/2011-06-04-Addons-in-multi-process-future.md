The most frequently asked questions on jetpack mailing list are concerning
content scripts. It's not obvious to users why are they powerless or why does
powerful modules don't have direct access to the content's dom & why do we
need to communicate between those two by emitting messages. The short answer is:
Mozilla platform is moving towards a model were separate processes are used for
chrome, content and add-ons. In order to make switch to such model painless for
add-on developers sdk modules were designed with [Electrolysis] in mind. Much
more details on that topic may be found in the [documentation of content
scripts].

Even though we won't ship 1.0 with support for [Electrolysis], some of us
([Atul][E10S-atul], [Alex][E10S-alex] and [me][E10S-me]) have explored few
ideas, but until few month ago I was still unsure we were heading a right
path.

Few month ago I was reading Peter Michaux's blog post about [MVC Architecture
for JavaScript Applications] from which I'd like to quote following description
of "Real MVC":

> "In a nutshell the classic MVC architecture works like this. There is a model
> that is at the heart of the whole thing. If the model changes, it notifies
> its observers that a change occurred. The view is the stuff you can see and
> the view observes the model. When the view is notified that the model has
> changed, the view changes its appearance. The user can interact with the
> view (e.g. clicking stuff) but the view doesnâ€™t know what to do. So the view
> tells the controller what the user did and assumes the controller knows what
> to do. The controller appropriately changes the model. And around and
> around it goes."

Even though I've been writing apps with [MVC] architecture for a while, it never
occurred to me to look at jetpack in MVC.

### Light side ###

Ironically most of Add-on SDK APIs provide access to the things that are
basically models, associated with a different views of the browser UI (like
[windows], [tabs], [widgets]). Also low level modules can be seen as controllers
of two types:

 1. Model observers that propagate changes to the associated views.
 2. View observers that update associated models.

Such perspective also makes whole multi-process architecture switch way more
simple. All we need to do is move models to the other process and make sure via
that changes on views and models are synchronized via controllers.

### Dark side ###

Unfortunately big part of the code base was not written with such MVC
perspective, or in other words we don't have a strict separation between models
and outlined controller types.

### Technical side ###

This part of the blog is probably too technical to enjoy and primary audience
is people hacking on jetpack itself, so feel free to skip :)

Overall everything boils down to few key components:

1. Pipe for delivering messages across processes, something like `port` on our
   worker objects.
2. Models, serializeable and fully reconstructible via JSON. This is important
   as models are going to live in add-on processes. Model synchronization can
   be implemented in one place in one function that just emits events on the
   port.
3. Controllers observing views, or in other words event listeners that extract
   and serialize interesting data from events and emits to the pipe so that
   models can react.
4. Controllers observing model changes, via listeners on the pipe and updating
   views.

Outlined strong separation of roles is good anyway and I tried to stick to it
to make transition to E10S easier.

1. Models that can be serialized / recreated:
[hotkey](https://github.com/mozilla/addon-sdk/blob/master/packages/addon-kit/lib/hotkeys.js)

2. Controllers that emit events on views (Browser UI) changes:
[tabs/observer](https://github.com/mozilla/addon-sdk/blob/master/packages/api-utils/lib/tabs/observer.js),
[keyboard/observer](https://github.com/mozilla/addon-sdk/blob/master/packages/api-utils/lib/keyboard/observer.js),
[windows/observer](https://github.com/mozilla/addon-sdk/blob/master/packages/api-utils/lib/windows/observer.js)

3. I don't have examples for controllers that updating views on model changes.

Finally here link to in progress [implementation of models] that I hope to get
into jetpack in a future.
