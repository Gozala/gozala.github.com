title: Reboot

I have decided to bring back to life my blog in order to:

1. Improve my writing skills (in English).
2. Share work I'm doing more effectively. 

Since I really wanted to have a dedicated domain and a playground for my 
JavaScript / HTML / CSS experiments [Wordpress] was not good enough anymore.
Recently I heard about [jekyll] from colleague and a good friend of mine
[Sergi Mansilla]. For those who don't know, it's a simple, blog aware, static
site generator. It is also an engine behind [GitHub Pages], allowing to host
project pages or blog right from [GitHub] repository. Yeah [Markdown]
formatted posts and `git push origin master` to publish post is a geek dream!!

With a slightly adjusted "[wordpressxml2jekyll]" script from [Marko Anastasov]
migrating posts from [Wordpres] appeared to be very simple. Some hacking with
[DisqUs] API's and comment's followed the same path. Few bits of HTML5 & CSS3
and we're up and running!!

Please don't forget to subscribe to a site [feed] I'll be posting soon!

And sorry to my fellow IE surfers, cause your eyes are probably bleeding now,
but you know what? Get a modern browser already, seriously!!
