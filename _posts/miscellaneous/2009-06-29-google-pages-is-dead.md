Well sometimes you have to face the fact that most of your links in your blog 
posts can get broken soon :(

Here is an email from Google I have received today:

> You've received this mandatory service announcement email to update you
> about important changes to your Google Page Creator account.

> Dear Google Page Creator User,  

> As was 
> [previously announced](http://googleappsposts.blogspot.com/2009/04/now-moving-to-google-sites.html), 
> Google will soon be discontinuing operation of the Google Page Creator product. 
> We will be migrating your Page Creator sites over to 
> [Google Sites](http://sites.google.com/) so that they continue to operate with
> no work on your part. However, we've identified you as using Google Page 
> Creator to host files that Sites doesn't support. We are writing to inform you
> that, as part of this migration, if you take no action to address this, your 
> hosted files will likely break. If they are important then we suggest you move
> them to a different hosting service.

> Contrary to what was posted in the blog post, the shut down and migration of 
> Google Page Creator has been extended and will begin in a few weeks.  
> Thank you for your patience during this migration.  

> Sincerely,  

> The Google Sites Team  

> Google, Inc.  
> 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway

So I had no other chance but, to move all my pages and images from my posts 
to other servers. Most painful move was moving ubiquity commands. 
Now commands do live on the github pages and I hope, I have updated all the 
links in my posts properly. In case if you'll find some broken links please 
report to me.

I hope Google won't ask me to move my emails as well some day !!
