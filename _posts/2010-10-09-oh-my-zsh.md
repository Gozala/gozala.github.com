I have been thinking about switching to the [zsh] shell for some time, mainly
because I was missing [vim] environment in the console. About a month ago
I've decided to switch. Quickly enough I got tired of tweaking my `.zshrc`, I
was about to give up when I discovered very nice project called [oh my zsh].

A community-driven framework for managing zsh configuration proved to be very
nice. At the end of the day I ended up with a new theme and improved git
plugin.

As you can see there is bunch of small icons on the right side that's a
visualisation of the git working tree:

    ✭  Displayed if there are modifications.  
    ✈  Displayed if there are staged changes.  
    ✗  Displayed if there are deleted files.  
    ➦  Displayed if there are moved files.  
    ⚑  Displayed if there are untracked files.  
    ⚡  Displayed if there is a merge conflict.  

Hope you're excited and considering to try out zsh. If that's a case I'll
definitely recommend to try out [oh my zsh]. There is already made [pull
request] with my new theme **gozilla** and get plugin improvements. If you
cant wait you can pull changes directly form my [fork].
