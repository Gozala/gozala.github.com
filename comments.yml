  Since I can confirm this problems for Ubuntu 8.10 and 9.04 (32-bit, german) described by starlex and Joey-Elijah:
  
  I have created a special Picasa Photo Viewer for Ubuntu package based on this one from Irakli Gozalishvili.
  
  You can find it here:

  And many thanks to Irakli again. Great work!

  Hi,
  in my ubuntu installation it is not working. I tried launching it from the terminal and I get the following error message:
  "run-detectors: unable to find an interpreter for
  /opt/google/picasa/3.0/wine/drive_c/Program
  Files/Google/Picasa3/PicasaPhotoViewer.exe"
  
  This is quite strange, as Picasa 3 itself works properly (so, the wine wrapper is ok).
  
  I am using Ubuntu 9.04 alpha 6, but I am pretty sure this is not an alpha-related issue, as another guy posted about the same problem on the ubuntu forum a few weeks ago.
  
  Could you please help me?
  
  Thanks a lot,
  Alex.

  I am having a problem in Ubuntu 9.04 with Picasa Photo Viewer where you click or right click to grab the photo to move it around but it is impossible to drop the photo.  So the mouse is fixed holding the image.  I can not click another application or alt-tab.  Or force click.  My only option is to hold down the power button to shutdown.
  
  Is anyone else experiencing this?
  Can anyone provide any troubleshooting advice?
  
  Thank you.

content: "Some great thoughts on Ubiquity here!<br/><br/>Here are some un-organised thoughts I had while reading this:<br/><br/>* I agree the hyphenated command names are horrible to use. Thankfully, command names with spaces will come one day. Also, Jono has a proposal on \"overlord verbs\" here: http://jonoscript.wordpress.com/2009/01/24/overlord-verbs-a-proposal/<br/><br/>* I'm undecided whether it would be a good thing to have modifiers that appear based on the presence of other modifiers. On one hand, its a big leap in complexity when using it. However, to a certain extent, sentance complexity is expected. I think its a matter of balancing those expectations. <br/><br/>* The diferrence between required and optional modifiers is potentially a big problem. For instance, what should happen if the user doesn't fill out a required modifier? I think from an interaction point of view, its far better to have all modifiers be optional. Ubiquity and the command should figure out to do regardless of whether a modifier has been filled in by the user.<br/><br/>* The difference between \"bug 123\" and \"#123\" and \"123\" is negligible. Given the context, they all mean the same thing, and should therefore be treated like they're the same.  As such, it should be the noun type that parses \"bug 123\" into \"123\", not Ubiquity."

  Kevin Dangoor of Mozilla labs talked about a port of Bespin's backend to JavaScript, you should get in touch with him about that. I don't see any files on the bespin repo yet, so I'm not sure if he's started.
  
  I had previous done some work to get Jack to run on XPCOM, but that was before it split into Narwhal. I'll probably start on a new Narwhal branch implementing the serverjs spec in XPCOM, let me know if you want to collab or already started.
  
  Your bespin idea is cool. I was thinking of packaging web apps running on Jack inside XULRunner. XPCOM is probably the most widely deployed serverjs capable environment already in use, being in Firefox, the possibilities are great.

  It seems very, very interesting. I'm currently considering which documentation tool to use for JavaScript and I'm quite frustrated: either they are very inflexible or not work at all when you start to do some 'complicated' things such as self-invocation anonymous functions, nested scopes and that sort of things.
  
  I've reached this page while looking for Rhino, source comments and similar keywords, since I think that the Rhino option is the only one available if we want the tool support any JavaScript construction, no matters how strange it be.
  
  I'll have a look at it, sure. Thank you very much for your efforts!
  
  By the way, couldn't it be possible make it even more flexible and allowing any documentation format (not just jsdoc). If you have done the tough work of extracting the comments from the source with the appropriate scope, it could be done delegating to some Formatter object. That will allow to use jsdoc but also, for example, restructured text to be passed to Sphinx or similar tools. It's just an idea.
  
  Thank you again!

  Thanks for your comment. At this point my tool is not that much flexible as well, but I'm definitely moving that direction. Currently in experimental branch I have some work done on rhino AST but it's not used by the tool yet. Feel free to fork me!!\r\n\

  Yes having flexible comment parser is something I would like to have as well, I was thinking to make comments parser / extractor being a plugin, that way it could be possible to write a different plugin which will process comments in a different manner."
