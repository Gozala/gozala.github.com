#  Wisp

A little [Clojure][]-like LISP in that compiles down to JS started was an [attempt][] to [improve][] [lispyscript][] and but end up becoming a fork with very different goals and priorities. I ❤️ [Clojure][], I think it provides very practical improvements to typical lisp, I want clojure semantics combined with an ability of interop with a JS ecosystem. Maintainer of [lispyscript][] wanted to JS semantics with lisp syntax.

I have learned a lot by contributing to [lispyscript][] compiler. I have decided to pursue my vision and turn wisp into what I wanted. I have rewrote compiler from JS into wisp making it self hosting.
