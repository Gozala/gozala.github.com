I had the privilege of working with Hugo Dias during our time at [Protocol Labs][], where we collaborated on both the [JS-IPFS][] and [web3.storage][] initiatives. Our collaboration reached its pinnacle with the implementation and  design of [UCAN][]-based protocols, and I am grateful for  the opportunity to have worked with Hugo on this project.

Hugo is a highly skilled software engineer with a talent for writing  clean, efficient, and well-documented code. He demonstrated exceptional  leadership qualities during our time working together, taking ownership  of complex projects and delivering results under tight deadlines. His contributions to each project have had a lasting impact and it is hard to imagine [web3.storage][] without his contributions.

In addition to his technical abilities, Hugo is a warm and friendly individual with a positive attitude and a great sense of humor. He  quickly became a more than a colleague, a true friend, and his energy and positivity were always a joy to be around.

I highly recommend Hugo for any software engineering role he may pursue. He is an intelligent, motivated, and results-driven individual who  consistently demonstrates his commitment to excellence. He will bring value to any organization he joins and be an asset to any team he is a  part of.

It was an honor to work with Hugo and I am grateful for the opportunity to have had him as a colleague and friend.
