I had the pleasure of working with JChris at [Protocol Labs][] on on various [web3.storage][] initiatives. He is a true visionary with a passion for creating innovative and impactful products. He consistently displayed a deep understanding of the ecosystem and how to effectively navigate it. JChris's ability to inspire and motivate his  team is truly remarkable. He has a magnetic personality and his endless  creativity and enthusiasm is contagious. Not only is JChris skilled in his role, but he is also an amazing person to work with. I highly  recommend JChris for any future endeavors as he is a true asset to any  organization.
